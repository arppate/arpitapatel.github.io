I’m glad you're here!

I am a DevOps Engineer with 7+ years of experience working across multiple MNCs and a passionate Machine Learning enthusiast. I specialize in designing and developing end-to-end CI/CD solutions, maintaining tools and software that optimize and streamline processes. My work directly contributes to enhancing the customer experience by ensuring efficient architecture and timely releases. I leverage my expertise in Python, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform to deliver scalable, robust, and secure solutions.

Previously, I worked as a DevOps Consultant at Mercedes Benz R&D and as a Build and Release Engineer at Hewlett Packard, where I led automation initiatives, reviewed project specifications, designed CI/CD pipelines, and resolved real-time issues. I also have experience working with Terraform to create scalable infrastructure solutions, and I specialize in Infrastructure as Code. My performance has earned me multiple awards for consistent excellence and outstanding contributions.

Recently, I graduated from Sheridan College with a specialization in IoT and Machine Learning. In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and baking. I also love writing, and you can check out my personal blog here.

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from O.P. Jindal Institute of Technology, where I graduated with a GPA of 8.2 and received a merit scholarship for academic excellence.

I’m passionate about giving back to society, and as part of this mission, I help students navigate their journey to becoming software developers in top tech companies, including FAANG. If you'd like to learn more or chat 1-on-1, feel free to schedule a call, and let’s explore how I can assist you!

Looking forward to connecting!
