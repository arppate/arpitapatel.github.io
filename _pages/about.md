I am glad you're here! 

I am a DevOps Engineer with 7+ years of experience across multiple MNC's and a Machine Learning Enthusiast. 
I design and develop End to End CI/CD solutions and maintain tools and software that optimize and streamline the process. My work directly contributes to enhancing the customer experience by ensuring efficient architecture and timely releases. I leverage my expertise in Python, AWS Cloud and Google Cloud Platform to deliver scalable, robust, and secure solutions.

Previously, I worked as a DevOps Consultant at Mercedes Benz R&D and a Build and Release Engineer at Hewlett Packard, where I led automation initiatives, reviewed project specifications, designed CI/CD Pipelines, and resolved real-time issues. I have worked with Terraform to create scalable Infrastructure solutions and specialize in Infrastructure as Code. I have received multiple awards for my consistent performance and outstanding contribution.
I have recently graduated from Sheridan College with a specialisaton in IoT and Machine Learning. During my leisure time, I enjoy reading, hikingbaking. I also like to write, you can checkout my personal blog [here](https://medium.com/@arpitapatel_85117).

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from O.P. Jindal Institute of Technology, where I graduated with a GPA of 8.2 and received a merit scholarship for my academic excellence.

I believe in giving back to the society and for that mission of mine, I help students navigate through the journey of landing as a Software Developer in Top Technology companies like FAANG through various ways possible.
